Project to clone google home page
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/html-css

Mini project to become familiar with HTML / CSS, web developer tools.

Worked on reducing the volume of code to achieve the same result.

There are still areas which I need to work on and may come back to this when more familiar.
